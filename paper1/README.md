# Big Data Analytics in Sports - Track and Field

## Abstract
Over the years, sports analytics has become more prominent in the way sports are evolving. Data is the driving force in how these improvements and changes are being made. With the presence of Big data and the impact it has on how sports decisions are being made, the importance on how this data can be used and how it can be presented in a useful manner have become a focal point for furthering athletics. This focus on data can be seen all over the professional sports world with many teams hiring data scientists and analysts to use data in order to get the most out of how they develop their rosters. Big data analytics within sports can cover a broad spectrum of topics, but the focus here is to dive deeper into the sport of track and field. First, we will take a look at what track and field looked like without the use of big data. Then, we will dive into the impacts big data has had on the development of track and field.
