        Over the years, sports analytics have become more prominent in the way
        sports are evolving. Data is the driving force in how these evolutions and
        changes are being made. With the presence of Big data and the impact it has
        on how sports decisions are being made, the importance on how this data can
        be used and how it can be presented in a useful manner have become a focal
        point for furthering athletics. Big data analytics within sports can cover
        a broad spectrum of topics, but the focus here is to dive deeper into the
        sport of track and field.
