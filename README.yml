        Over the years, sports analytics has become more prominent in the way sports are evolving. 
        Data is the driving force in how these improvements and changes are being made. With the 
        presence of Big data and the impact it has on how sports decisions are being made, the 
        importance on how this data can be used and how it can be presented in a useful manner 
        have become a focal point for furthering athletics. This focus on data can be seen all 
        over the professional sports world with many teams hiring data scientists and analysts to 
        use data in order to get the most out of how they develop their rosters. Big data analytics 
        within sports can cover a broad spectrum of topics, but the focus here is to dive deeper into 
        the sport of track and field. First, we will take a look at what track and field looked like 
        without the use of big data. Then, we will dive into the impacts big data has had on the 
        development of track and field.

        Since its origins, Big Data has promised an unimaginable potential to revolutionize 
        the world. Scholars have wisely noted that it represents a paradigmatic shift from 
        conventional norms of data, but the public has quickly latched onto provocative but 
        unrealistic narratives that deify big data as omniscient, infallible, and devoid 
        of bias. Confiding in such narratives diminishes the integrity of credible science 
        and poses serious ethical challenges, but these challenges are more likely overlooked 
        because the very narratives seem to reject the need for ethical discussion. The authors 
        argue that such blind optimism will cause irreversible damage to society if left 
        unchecked. First we debunk the fallacious narratives people tend to tell about big 
        data, offering a more realistic discussion of its merits and its limitations. 
        We then explore how analytical or algorithmic bias and sampling bias, two problems 
        that statisticians have faced since long before the onset of big data, present pitfalls 
        for deriving knowledge from data. We examine how the ethical implications of these pitfalls 
        can cause serious damage in society. We conclude that Big Data analysis must obey the 
        principles of transparency, clear and appropriate objective definition, and 
        self-correcting feedback mechanisms.

        Since its origins, Big Data has promised an unimaginable
        potential to revolutionize the world. Scholars have wisely
        noted that it represents a paradigmatic shift from
        conventional norms of data, but the public has quickly latched
        onto provocative but unrealistic narratives that deify big
        data as omniscient, infallible, and devoid of bias. Confiding
        in such narratives diminishes the integrity of credible
        science and poses serious ethical challenges, but these
        challenges are more likely overlooked because the very
        narratives seem to reject the need for ethical discussion. The
        authors argue that such blind optimism will cause irreversible
        damage to society if left unchecked. First we debunk the
        fallacious narratives people tend to tell about big data,
        offering a more realistic discussion of its merits and its
        limitations.  We then explore how analytical or algorithmic
        bias and sampling bias, two problems that statisticians have
        faced since long before the onset of big data, present
        pitfalls for deriving knowledge from data. We examine how the
        ethical implications of these pitfalls can cause serious
        damage in society. We determine that effective, credible, and 
        ethically sound Big Data analysis must obey the principles of 
        transparency, clear and appropriate objective definition, and 
        self-correcting feedback mechanisms. We examine case studies 
        where academicians and businesses have tested algorithms to 
        study how well they exhibit these principles. We then 
        implement our own test to check for potential algorithmic 
        bias in Google. Based on evidence that certain individuals, 
        including Dylan Roof, were corrupted in part by Google queries 
        allegedly bias against minority groups, we hypothesize that 
        Google's algorithms systematically exhibit biases against 
        minority groups. We test this hypothesis by examining how Google 
        search suggestions associate certain negative words with names 
        that typically belong to minority groups. We conclude that while 
        our study alone cannot prove or disprove the hypothesis, owing 
        to the fallibility of big data analysis which we cover in detail, 
        the evidence in our analysis contradicts our hypothesis, thus 
        supporting the null hypothesis that no systematic bias in 
        exhibited. We discuss what this could mean for future studies of 
        potential algorithmic bias in Google.
