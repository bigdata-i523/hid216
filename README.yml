        Over the years, sports analytics have become more prominent in the way
        sports are evolving. Data is the driving force in how these evolutions and
        changes are being made. With the presence of Big data and the impact it has
        on how sports decisions are being made, the importance on how this data can
        be used and how it can be presented in a useful manner have become a focal
        point for furthering athletics. Big data analytics within sports can cover
        a broad spectrum of topics, but the focus here is to dive deeper into the
        sport of track and field.

        Since its origins, Big Data has promised an unimaginable potential to revolutionize 
        the world. Scholars have wisely noted that it represents a paradigmatic shift from 
        conventional norms of data, but the public has quickly latched onto provocative but 
        unrealistic narratives that deify big data as omniscient, infallible, and devoid 
        of bias. Confiding in such narratives diminishes the integrity of credible science 
        and poses serious ethical challenges, but these challenges are more likely overlooked 
        because the very narratives seem to reject the need for ethical discussion. The authors 
        argue that such blind optimism will cause irreversible damage to society if left 
        unchecked. First we debunk the fallacious narratives people tend to tell about big 
        data, offering a more realistic discussion of its merits and its limitations. 
        We then explore how analytical or algorithmic bias and sampling bias, two problems 
        that statisticians have faced since long before the onset of big data, present pitfalls 
        for deriving knowledge from data. We examine how the ethical implications of these pitfalls 
        can cause serious damage in society. We conclude that Big Data analysis must obey the 
        principles of transparency, clear and appropriate objective definition, and 
        self-correcting feedback mechanisms.
