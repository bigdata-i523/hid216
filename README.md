   title: Big Data Analytics in Sports - Track and Field
   abstract: Over the years, sports analytics have become more prominent in the way sports are evolving. Data is the driving force in how these evolutions and changes are being made. With the presence of Big data and the impact it has on how sports decisions are being made, the importance on how this data can be used and how it can be presented in a useful manner have become a focal point for furthering athletics. Big data analytics within sports can cover a broad spectrum of topics, but the focus here is to dive deeper into the sport of track and field.
